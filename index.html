        <p> The most honest, wildly enjoyable book written about motherhood is surely Anne Lamott's 
            account of her son Sam's first year. A gifted writer and teacher, 
            Lamott (Crooked Little Heart) is a single mother and ex-alcoholic with 
            a pleasingly warped social circle and a remarkably tolerant religion to lean on. 
            She responds to the changes, exhaustion, and love Sam brings with aplomb or 
            outright insanity. The book rocks from hilarious to unbearably poignant
            when Sam's burgeoning life is played out against a very close friend's illness. 
            No saccharine paean to becoming a parent, this touches on the rage 
            and befuddlement that dog sweeter emotions during this sea change in one's 
            life.</p>

            <p> “Peg came over with dinner tonight and told me about this dumb <br>schmaltzy poem 
                she heard someone read at an AA meeting.<br> It got me thinking.  
                It was about how while we are on earth,
                our limitations <br> are such that we can only see the underside of the 
                tapestry that God is weaving. <br> 
                God sees the topside, the whole evolving portrait 
                and its amazing beauty,<br> and uses us as the pieces of thread 
                to weave the picture.  We see the glorious colors <br>and shadings, 
                but we also see the knots and the threads hanging down,<br> 
                the think lumpy patches, the tangles. <br> But God and the people in heaven
                with him see how beautiful the portraits in the tapestry are. <br> 
                The poem says in this flowery way that faith is about the willingness
                to be used by God wherever<br> and however he most needs you, most needs
                the piece of thread that is your life. <br> You give him your life to
                put through his needle, to use as he sees fit.”</p>

                <p> "One thing about having a baby is that each step of the way you
                     simply cannot imagine loving him <br>any more than you already do,
                     because you are bursting with love, loving as<br> much as you are 
                     humanly capable of- and then you do, you love<br> him even more."</p>
